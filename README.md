# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 homework.  The purpose of this analysis is to correctly predict the creditworthiness of borrowers.

In the confusion matrix, the model is nearly always right in correctly predicting creditworthiness, with an accuracy of 0.998 (the precision).

For bad loan risk it fares much less well, with an accuracy of 0.84.

The recall is 0.97.

I don't really recommend this model as it struggles to correctly predict bad loan risk.
